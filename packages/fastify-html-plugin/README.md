## Documentation

`@kitajs/html` is a `JSX` -> `string` runtime, this package seamlessly integrates with
`fastify` to improve the developer experience while also providing faster implementations
for this use case.

- Read [`@kitajs/html` documentation](https://github.com/kitajs/html) for help with
  templating, and all other stuff related to `<jsx />`.
- Read [`@kitajs/ts-html-plugin` documentation.](https://github.com/kitajs/ts-html-plugin)
  for help setting up the **XSS** detector and IDE intellisense.

## API

### `reply.html()`

**Synchronously** waits for the component tree to resolve and sends it at once to the
browser.

This method does not support the usage of `<Suspense />`, please use `streamHtml` instead.

If the HTML does not start with a doctype and `opts.autoDoctype` is enabled, it will be
added automatically.

The correct `Content-Type` header will also be defined.

```tsx
app.get('/', (req, reply) =>
  reply.html(
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
);
```

### `reply.streamHtml()`

Sends the html to the browser as a single stream, the entire component tree will be waited
synchronously. When using any `Suspense`, its fallback will be synchronously waited and
sent to the browser in the original stream, as its children are resolved, new pieces of
html will be sent to the browser. When all `Suspense`s pending promises are resolved, the
connection is closed normally.

> [!NOTE]  
> `request.id` must be used as the `Suspense`'s `rid` parameter

This method hijacks the response, as the html stream is just a single continuous stream in
the http body, any changes to the status code or headers after calling this method **will
not have effect**.

If the HTML does not start with a doctype and `opts.autoDoctype` is enabled, it will be
added automatically. The correct `Content-Type` header will also be defined.

**Http trailers are not yet supported when using `streamHtml`**

```tsx
app.get('/', (req, reply) =>
  reply.streamHtml(
    <Suspense rid={req.id} fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <MyAsyncComponent />
    </Suspense>
  )
);
```

### `reply.setupHtmlStream()`

This function is called internally by the `streamHtml` getter.

> [!NOTE]  
> Executing code before sending the response and after creating your html is a bad pattern
> and should be avoided!

This function must be called **manually** at the top of the route handler when you have to
execute some code **after** your root layout and **before** the `streamHtml call.

If `setupHtmlStream` is executed and no call to `streamHtml` happens before the request
finishes, a memory leak will be created. Make sure that `setupHtmlStream` will never be
executed without being followed by `streamHtml`.

```tsx
app.get('/bad', (_, reply) => {
  const html = <Layout />; // Error: Request data was deleted before all
  // suspense components were resolved.

  // code that must be executed after the template
  foo();

  return reply.streamHtml(html);
});

app.get('/good', (_, reply) => {
  reply.setupHtmlStream();

  const html = <Layout />; // works!

  // code that must be executed after the template
  foo();

  return reply.streamHtml(html);
});
```
