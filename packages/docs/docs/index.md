## Quick Example

```tsx
// this is true
typeof (<div>hello</div>) === 'string';

// Simply write JSX and use it anywhere
import fs from 'node:fs';

fs.writeFileSync(
  'index.html',
  <p>
    Hello, <strong>world</strong>!
  </p>
);
```

## Why KitaJS Html?

Unlike React which builds a virtual DOM, KitaJS Html directly produces HTML strings,
making it **perfect for server-side rendering**. It's the fastest way to generate HTML on
the server while maintaining the familiar JSX syntax you already know.

**Key Benefits:**

- 🚀 **10-40x faster** than React's `renderToStaticMarkup`
- 🔒 **Compile-time XSS detection** catches vulnerabilities before deployment
- ⚡ **Streaming support** with Suspense for progressive rendering
- 🎨 **Familiar JSX syntax** - no new templating language to learn
- 🛠️ **Full TypeScript support** with autocomplete for HTML, HTMX, and more
